## Background & Objectives

For this challenge, we are giving you some creative freedom ðŸ¤“. Go to [pages.xyz](https://www.pages.xyz/) (a website created by an alumnus of Le Wagon) and find a page that you find cool, but not something that looks **too** complicated ðŸ˜‰.

## Specs

Once you have found a page that you like, have a go at trying to recreate it!
